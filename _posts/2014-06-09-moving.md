So, by this time next week I should be sleeping, preparing myself to wake up and drive a very large Penske truck to Chattanooga, TN. Most likely I will be up working on some code because I can't sleep. We'll see what happens. 

As I lay here on the sofa writing this, I can't help but but freak out over the fact that the place I have called "home" for the last 5 years is about to become a memory. No longer will driving the the Murphy Express for a late night Icee be a thing, nor will taking the "scenic route" past campus from the other side of town.
